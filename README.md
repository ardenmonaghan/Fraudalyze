Fraudalyze is a data analytics project that leverages machine learning and statistical methodologies to detect fraudulent insurance claims. The project operates on a test dataset containing 40,000 users and 200,000 logged claims, identifying anomalies and visualizing them using Streamlit.

Additionally, a machine learning model is developed to assess fraud probability based on customer information.

## 🚀 Project Features
- ✔ Fraud Detection – Identifies potential fraudulent claims
- ✔ Anomaly Detection – Highlights unusual patterns in transactions
- ✔ Machine Learning Model – Predicts fraud probability based on user data
- ✔ Interactive Dashboard – Users can explore fraud trends in Streamlit

## 📊 Dataset Information:

There are two major datasets operated on. 

- customer_info.csv: This dataset contains information about the customers such as their income, coverage limit, and other relevant information.
- transactions.csv: Contains information about transactions that have happened with a current user and their income, coverage limit, and Reward information for their account.
